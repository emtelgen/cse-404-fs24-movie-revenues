# Project 1 Step 4: Data Reader & Starting Initial Model

- Step 1 is the reader and you need to have that correctly done. 
- Step 2 is more for your exploration and learning at this stage, try to do something about it as much as you can, a naive initial model would be ok here.

## Step 1: 
- Data Reader is a program that reads data items from files and folders into your machine learning program, and creates training/testing examples. Depending on how clean/structured is your data this step might need a bit of work for you.
> Please, push the code to your GitHub repository and post the commit's URL here in D2L. 

## Step 2: 
- Initial Model. When you have the data reader in place, use a learning algorithm on the data, and evaluate its performance, even a naive initial working model that is made by your team would be sufficient.  Also, please write up the following information: 

- What is the setting of your project? is it supervised, unsupervised, or semisupervised? (I think everybody got supervision for this class though). 
- How you represent X (Features/Representation  and their explanation, justification)
- How do you represent Y (binary? multi-class? sequences? trees? graphs?)
- Which libraries you will use?

> Note that, all this information will be a part of your final project report.

### You might use any machine learning or deep learning libraries for your project or even use your own implemented algorithm, in any case, you will need to do the following:

#### Make a test/train split of the data
2. Use your machine learning algorithm to learn from your training set
3. Evaluate the model with the test set.
4. Send a report summary about the model's performance on train and test datasets (it is fine that it is very low at this stage).
5. Push your code to your repository on GitHub, and post a link to it here in response to this assignment.
> Please make sure to give us access to your code using our GitHub ids (Kordjamshidi,Sanya1001,afsharim).
